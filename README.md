## Timing Comparison: Loop vs. Recursion

### Given Times
- **Loop time**: `65.5 µs × 1000 = 65,500 ns`
- **Recursion time**: `92 ns`

### Speedup Calculation

The speedup is calculated as:

```text
Speedup = Loop time / Recursion time
        = 65,500 / 92
        ≈ 712
```



### Conclusion
The recursive implementation is approximately **712 times faster** than the loop implementation.
